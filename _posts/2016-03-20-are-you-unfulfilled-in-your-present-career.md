Are you unfulfilled in your present career? 

Have business ideas but don't know how to get started? 

Not sure what your next career move should be? 

Struggling to balance your career with your family?

Sin√©ad Howland Career Coaching is an independent local career coaching consultancy based in St Albans, Hertfordshire. I am a mum of two young children, hold an MA in Careers and am also a licensed Firework Career Coach, accredited by the International Coach Federation.
As a mum of two I truly understand the difficulties we face when it comes to balancing a career with family life. 

I offer coaching sessions from my home in St Albans during the daytime.
I offer a full career coaching programme for those looking for a career change or looking to return to work after a career break. Making career changes and choices can be a daunting experience; there are so many questions that need answering and decisions to be made. My tailored career coaching programme will encourage you to Explore, Dream and Discover the career that is absolutely right for you, and a plan of how to create it.
One-off career guidance sessions are also available.
