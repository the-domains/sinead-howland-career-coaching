# Part 2, Malaysia, USA and Canada

### So there I was, a fully qualified careers adviser with lots of experience under my belt, ready to get back to work. My partner's company had other ideas though. He was offered an 18 month contract in Malaysia. How could we refuse? It sounded perfect, so off we went.

It was amazing, we did so much travelling around Asia and got married in New Zealand. Not being the type to sit back and enjoy the expat life, I decided to volunteer at Women's Aid organisation[http://www.wao.org.my][0], a shelter for abused women and their children. I ran a weekly group for residents to come and work on their CVs and chat about finding jobs. It was a real eye opener. I met some truly incredible women.

One young woman was escaping her husband and had no choice but to leave her young son behind. She had gone through so much and was picked up by the charity from a police cell, where she had been arrested for allegedly stealing from her husband. Broken, lonely and missing her child, slowly she pieced her life back together, found a job and somewhere to live, and finally got her son back.

Another woman I met, that will stay with me forever was pregnant with her fifth child. Fleeing abuse she had to leave her other children behind. So concerned was she for the welfare of her unborn child, one day she begged me to adopt it. She felt she would not be able to support that child or get the other children back. It was so heart-breaking to see a woman beg for me to take her child and give it a home. This was especially poignant at a time when we were trying for a baby and suffering multiple miscarriages. As we worked together for a while it transpired she had run her husband's business for him, a shop that employed a number of people. She had been managing staff and stock and serving customers, not to mention running a house! Over time she realised she had a lot of skills and potential. Last I heard, she was working and had kept her child.

I also took the opportunity to complete my Masters degree in Careers by distance learning. As part of this, I volunteered at HELP University, Kuala Lumpur, in the CAREERsense department. I wrote the curriculum for the career education programme for students and delivered it to a class of 200 second-year Psychology students. I had previous experience delivering career education to small groups of around six, but attempting to deliver practical, useful and engaging careers education to a much larger group was a huge challenge, but a fun one. I am still in contact with many of the students now. This experience also informed my Masters research.

After eighteen months we left the tropical heat of Malaysia and arrived in the USA in time for the Minnesota winter. With no work visa and pregnant with my first child, I spent my ten months there writing my research and left the USA with a beautiful baby girl.

Canada next, and I have to say this was my favourite. After almost three years living in Toronto I had another beautiful baby girl and lots of happy memories. I took a course with an amazing careers company, Life Strategies, in self-employment and I was on the executive committee for my daughter's cooperative playschool. I very much enjoyed the time in Canada as a stay at home mum and had plans to be the President of the playschool. However, once again, my husband's career had other ideas. After five years, almost to the day, we moved home older, wiser I hope, and married with two children.

#### Next, our move to St Albans and starting my business...
