# Where did it all start?

### Starting your own business in an area like coaching is very intimate. I want to work with people, find out who they are, what inspires them and how I can help them be the best they can be. To do this I think it is important for people to know more about me, who I am, where I've been, what I've done, where I'm going. I'm proud to be a wife and mother, and care deeply about these roles. But I also care deeply about helping others, so here's a bit about me....

My own journey through education was less than inspiring, I did not like school and I was keen to get into the world of work. I tried my hand at many things. Nursing, a great career, but my health let me down. Sales, I was good at this, at my best, working for Tiny Computers (remember them?), I was in the top ten for sales across the company nationwide, not to mention their first female salesperson. Imagine, women selling computers!

Inspired by my success I moved to London and landed a job selling advertising in building magazines. Yep, building, construction, architecture, property, fun stuff. It was fun, the environment, the team, the social life. Claim to fame in this job was being the first person The Builder Group sales team employed that did not have a degree. Many were not happy about this, it took a lot to prove that I could talk business with architects, decision makers, CEOs, not to mention I was able to get them to part with money. I was headhunted by a media recruitment consultant that first placed me to work with them. Great compliment. It turned out to be a pretty bad move, very pushy, very competitive, very unpleasant working conditions. We've all been there I'm sure, working in an environment that makes you miserable. I remember it well, a beautiful Friday afternoon, I thought 'seriously, what am I doing here?', I walked out.

What I didn't think about that sunny Friday afternoon was how on earth I'd pay my rent and eat. I took a job temping at an FE college to get by whilst I reassessed my options. The pay was awful and barely covered my rent. However, I met the college careers team, a small group of people who spent their time helping people. Talking to them, listening, getting to know them and on many occasions helping them change their lives.

Wow, a match made in heaven. Sales is all about finding out what people want or need, then telling them what that they need is what I was selling. Careers is about truly finding out who a person is, what motivates them, what inspires them and most importantly what next. Being a particularly curious person I loved the idea of a job where I could listen to people's stories, help them make sense from them and make positive change. I'm the type of person that can find out a persons life story, just from a chance meeting. I can't resist finding out about people, they are so fascinating!

I landed a position in the team covering someone on maternity leave and stayed there for 6 years. I met so many amazing people, learnt so much about different cultures and consumed a lot of curry. The college was in Tower Hamlets, very underprivileged, yet has Canary Wharf on its doorstep. It was this job that inspired me to save up and return to education.

Next step -- University, aged 32 I finally made it. Of course being the type of person that likes to be different I applied for a postgraduate diploma in career guidance, but I didn't have a degree. I had experience and I managed to persuade the university to let me in and they did. Again, time to prove myself, with a few 'distinctions' on my dissertations I did just that. It was a full time course, a lot of study and practical placements in schools, colleges and charities. So many amazing memories, too many to write about, well may be all the wine we consumed after class affected my memory...

2008 finally fully qualified with a Postgraduate Diploma in Career Guidance (QCG), I was ready to return to work, but my partner was offered a job in Malaysia of course.
