            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Where did it all start?</h1><h2>Starting your own business in an area like coaching is very intimate. I want to work with people, find out who they are, what inspires them and how I can help them be the best they can be. To do this I think it is important for people to know more about me, who I am, where I’ve been, what I’ve done, where I’m going. I’m proud to be a wife and mother, and care deeply about these roles. But I also care deeply about helping others, so here’s a bit about me….</h2><p>My own journey through education was less than inspiring, I did not like school and I was keen to get into the world of work. I tried my hand at many things. Nursing, a great career, but my health let me down. Sales, I was good at this, at my best, working for Tiny Computers (remember them?), I was in the top ten for sales across the company nationwide, not to mention their first female salesperson. Imagine, women selling computers!</p></article>]]></description>
